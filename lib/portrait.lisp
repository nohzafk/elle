## lib/portrait.lisp — semantic portraits from compile/analyze
##
## Builds structured descriptions of functions and modules from analysis
## handles, surfacing non-obvious properties: effect phases, failure
## modes, composition properties, and observations about implicit
## decisions.
##
## Usage:
##   (def portrait (import "std/portrait"))
##   (def a (compile/analyze (file/read "myfile.lisp") {:file "myfile.lisp"}))
##   (println (portrait:function a :my-fn))
##   (println (portrait:module a))
##   (println (portrait:render (portrait:function a :my-fn)))
