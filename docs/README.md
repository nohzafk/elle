# Elle Documentation

This directory contains language references, design documents, and contributor
guides. See [QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md) for the full table of contents.

## These files are programs

Every `.md` file in this directory is simultaneously a piece of documentation
**and** a runnable Elle program. The reader recognizes `.md` as a first-class
source format: when you run

```sh
elle docs/control.md
```

the reader extracts every fenced code block tagged ` ```lisp ` or ` ```elle `,
replaces all other lines (prose, tables, other code fences) with blank lines
so source positions line up with the original markdown, and feeds the result
to the standard s-expression reader. Error messages point back to the exact
`.md` line and column.

This means these files serve three roles at once:

- **Documentation** — readable on GitHub, in your editor, or rendered on the
  generated site.
- **Demos and examples** — every code sample is real code that was executed
  the last time the tests ran; there are no stale snippets that "used to work".
- **Tests** — `make doctest` runs every `.md` file under `docs/` and fails
  loudly if anything stops working. When you change an interface, the doc
  for that interface either updates or breaks the build.

Write docs the same way you'd write a test: pick something to demonstrate,
show the code, assert the result. Anything you put in a ` ```lisp ` block
is code the build will execute. Anything outside a fenced block is prose
that the reader will skip. See [`impl/reader.md`](impl/reader.md) for the
full pipeline and [`../src/reader/mod.rs`](../src/reader/mod.rs)'s
`strip_markdown` for the exact extraction rules.
