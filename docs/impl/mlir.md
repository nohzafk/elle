# MLIR Backend

> **Feature-gated:** The MLIR backend requires `--features mlir` at build
> time and a working LLVM 22 + MLIR install (the `melior` crate links to
> them). It is disabled by default. If your MLIR install lives outside the

> of `~/.cargo/config.toml`. That file is per-user, so the repository
> carries no machine-specific paths.

The MLIR backend is a tier-2 path that takes a hot, **GPU-eligible**
`LirFunction`, lowers it through the MLIR `arith` / `func` / `cf` /
`memref` dialects, converts to the LLVM dialect, and JIT-compiles via
the MLIR `ExecutionEngine`. The result is a native function pointer
called from the VM with C calling convention.

It runs alongside the bytecode VM and the Cranelift JIT — not as a
replacement. The same eligibility predicate also drives SPIR-V emission
for GPU dispatch (see [impl/spirv.md](spirv.md) and
[impl/gpu.md](gpu.md)).

## Pipeline

```text
LirFunction → lower_to_module → MLIR (arith/func/cf/memref)
            → PassManager(create_to_llvm) → LLVM dialect
            → ExecutionEngine::new           → native code
            → invoke_packed                  → i64 result
```

The eligibility check (`LirFunction::is_gpu_eligible`) is layered:

1. **Signal** — only `errors`-or-silent functions; no yield, I/O, FFI,
   or polymorphic.
2. **Structural** — `Arity::Exact(N)`, no mutable cells
   (`capture_params_mask == 0`, `capture_locals_mask == 0`).
   Immutable captures are allowed — they become extra parameters in
   the MLIR signature.
3. **Instruction whitelist** — every `LirInstr` and `Terminator` must
   be GPU-safe (constants, `ValueConst` with numeric/bool/nil values,
   arithmetic, comparison, local slots, parameter/capture loads,
   `Jump` / `Branch` / `Return`).

A second, stricter predicate `is_mlir_cpu_eligible` additionally
checks that the returned register is reachable from numeric
operations only — nil constants are rejected because `i64(0)` can't
be distinguished from the integer `0` at rebox time. Bool/compare
returns are fine: the caller checks `ScalarType::Bool` and reboxes
with `Value::bool(result != 0)`. CPU dispatch uses the strict
predicate; GPU dispatch (where the caller reads i64s out of a buffer)
uses the looser one.

## Value model

MLIR sees a flat scalar world: every Elle value enters as `i64`.
Float parameters are bitcast i64→f64 at function entry; float
returns are bitcast f64→i64 before `func.return`. A `ScalarType`
tag (`Int`, `Float`, or `Bool`) tracks each SSA value's type for
dispatch between integer and float MLIR ops, and for reboxing
the result.

| Elle constant | MLIR encoding | ScalarType |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| `Int(n)`      | `arith.constant n : i64` | Int |
| `Bool(b)`     | `0` or `1` | Bool |
| `Nil`         | `0` | Int |
| `Float(f)`    | `f.to_bits() as i64` | Float |
| Compare result | `arith.cmpi` → `arith.extui` to i64 | Bool |

Bool and Int are both i64 at the MLIR level; the distinction only
matters for reboxing (`Value::bool` vs `Value::int`) and for the
slot conflict check (Bool vs Int don't conflict; Float vs non-Float
do).

Local slots use `memref.alloca` of `memref<i64>` allocated in the
entry block — that handles cross-block phi-style patterns
(`StoreLocal` in one block, `LoadLocal` in another) without needing
to lower SSA φ nodes by hand. Within a block, LIR `Reg`s map directly
to MLIR `Value`s.

Comparisons emit `arith.cmpi` (returns `i1`) immediately followed by
`arith.extui` to `i64`. Branches compare the cond reg to `0` with
`cmpi ne` rather than truncating to `i1` — `trunci` would take the
low bit and read e.g. `2` as false.

## VM integration

`VM::try_mlir_call` (in `src/vm/mlir_entry.rs`) is consulted on every
closure call before the Cranelift JIT path. It:

1. Skips non-`is_gpu_candidate` closures (cheap field check).
2. Returns the cached engine result if available.
3. Returns early if the closure is in the rejection set.
4. Reads the closure call counter — only proceeds past
   `jit_hotness_threshold`. The counter is owned by the JIT path,
   which runs after MLIR; MLIR only reads.
5. Runs `is_mlir_cpu_eligible` (full instruction walk).
6. Compiles via `MlirCache::compile`, caches by bytecode pointer,
   and invokes.

**Captures** are extracted from `closure.env[0..num_captures]`,
validated as numeric (int or float), unboxed to i64, and prepended
to the argument array. A `capture_types: u64` bitmask tracks which
captures are float.

**Arguments** are unboxed to i64: integers pass through directly;
floats are bitcast f64→i64 by the caller. A `param_types: u64`
bitmask (bit i = 1 means param i is float) is passed to
`lower_to_module`, which inserts `arith.bitcast(i64→f64)` at
function entry for float params.

The MLIR function signature is `[captures..., params...]`, all i64.
Both bitmasks are part of the cache key
`(bytecode_ptr, capture_types, param_types)`, so the same closure
called with `(f 1)` vs `(f 1.0)` gets separate compiled code.
Non-numeric args or captures fall through to bytecode.

The result is reboxed based on the compiled function's return type:
- `ScalarType::Int` → `Value::int(result)`
- `ScalarType::Float` → `Value::float(f64::from_bits(result))`
- `ScalarType::Bool` → `Value::bool(result != 0)`

Failures are reported as a structured error
(`error_val("mlir-error", ...)`) carried via `SIG_ERROR` — the
rejection is also recorded so future calls don't retry.

## MlirCache

`MlirCache` owns:

- A single `melior::Context` with all dialects registered (~4ms to
  create — done once).
- `engines: HashMap<(*const u8, u64, u64), (ExecutionEngine, String, ScalarType)>` —
  keyed by (bytecode pointer, capture_types, param_types).
- `spirv_cache: HashMap<*const u8, Vec<u8>>` — SPIR-V bytes from
  `compile_spirv` (see [impl/spirv.md](spirv.md)).
- `rejections: HashSet<(*const u8, u64, u64)>` — (pointer,
  capture_types, param_types) triples known to fail.

The cache lives on the VM and is `unsafe impl Send + Sync` because
the VM is single-threaded; the engine and context are never accessed
concurrently.
