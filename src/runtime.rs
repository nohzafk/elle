//! The process runtime: one lifecycle for compile/evaluate, shared by every
//! entry path (`elle foo.lisp`, the REPL, and the embedding API).
//!
//! A [`Runtime`] owns the VM, symbol table, and per-instance compile state
//! (a [`RuntimeCore`], which points the VM at the symbol table and compile
//! context), registers primitives and
//! (optionally) loads the stdlib, and — on `Drop` or an explicit
//! [`Runtime::teardown`] — runs the **process teardown sweep** specified in
//! docs/impl/region/rules.md § "Teardown — every region frees":
//!
//! 1. **RC-driven, never iterate-and-free.** It releases the registered process
//!    roots (each decref'd once) and lets the ordinary region RC cascade reclaim
//!    everything reachable. It never walks the region table freeing entries —
//!    that would mask the very leaks this contract exists to surface.
//! 2. **Observable.** It returns a [`TeardownReport`] naming the live region
//!    residue (the open leaks); the end-state target is zero regions remaining.
//!
//! Because all three paths run this one routine, their teardown behaviour cannot
//! drift. The naive user model holds: `elle foo.lisp` is
//! `(eval (wrap-in-letrec (read-all (slurp "foo.lisp"))))`, and afterward the
//! world returns to its pre-`main` state — only the native-fn primitives persist
//! (immediates, occupying no region).
