// ── Spec pins (docs/impl/region/ctx.md) ─────────────────────────────
//
// Written from the spec BEFORE the implementation (CLAUDE.md: docs →
// tests → code). Each pins a contract line:
//  - `alloc` routes the object into exactly the ctx's region (Rule 3:
//    born in the right region — not a sibling region).
//  - `alloc_slice` payload shares the ctx's region (region/model.md
//    "RegionSlice contents share their object's region").
//  - the captured `RuntimeRegion` (threaded by `with_ctx`, or read via the
//    `cfg(test)`-only `test_region`) is where every `ctx.*` allocation lands —
//    there is no public region getter in production (the ctx owns its region).
