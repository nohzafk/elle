//! Channel primitives — crossbeam-channel wrappers for inter-fiber messaging.
//!
//! ## Scheduler-aware select
//!
//! `chan/select` cannot use crossbeam's blocking `Select::select_timeout`
//! because that parks the OS thread on which the fiber scheduler runs —
//! starving any `ev/spawn`'d producer fiber that would have unblocked the
//! select.  Instead each channel carries a shared `WakeList` of eventfd
//! file descriptors.  A selecting fiber allocates an eventfd, registers it
//! in every candidate receiver's `WakeList`, and yields with
//! `IoOp::ChanSelectPark` — the scheduler waits on the eventfd via
//! `IORING_OP_POLL_ADD` (or `poll(2)` on the thread-pool backend), exactly
//! like `ev/poll-fd`.  `chan/send`, after a successful `try_send`, signals
//! every registered eventfd so any parked selector wakes and re-tries.
//! Cross-thread `chan/send` (from `sys/spawn`) wakes the scheduler thread
//! the same way — `write(eventfd, 1)` is thread-safe and the kernel poll
//! notices it.

// Everything below that is cfg'd out on wasm32 is a *primitive* — the module keeps
// only its data types there (see `RawFd` and `WakeList` below), and these imports
// serve the primitive bodies alone.
