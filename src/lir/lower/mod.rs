        //   reclaims it, that decref faults. So a member releases before its owner. The

        //   store site → `(member, owner)`) and `capture_adopt_edges` (capture-adopted,
        //   each closure site → `(captured, closure)`), disjoint per member — a member is
        //   adopted by its single owner through exactly one map (region/info.rs).
        // - **Value aliasing.** A region that may be — or live inside — another is
        //   released `DecrefValueRegion`-style, resolving its runtime region by READING
        //   the value's own page, which the other's release can tear. Where the two land
        //   on one point (a discarded read, whose alias dies exactly where its container
        //   does), the alias must be ordered ahead. The same three relations the ownership
        //   cut's alias obligation closes over supply these edges, oriented
        //   `alias → source` throughout (region/adopt.md § "The lifetime obligation the
        //   root carries"): a native read's result and the container it read from
        //   (`counted_read_aliases`), an opaque call's result and its arguments
        //   (`opaque_result_aliases`), and a `Funnel`'s result and its container
        //   (`funnel_result_containers`). They compose transitively through the sort, so a
        //   read out of a CALL's result — whose recorded container is the call's
        //   placeholder, not the container the call handed back — is still ordered ahead

        //   lifetime instead (region/rules.md Rule 4).

/// Debug-only: no block frees an env cell before an instruction that reads through
/// that same cell.
///
/// A captured binding's value and its box are addressed by one env index, and the
/// value's release loads the box RAW and unwraps it to the content — so it READS
/// the page the box's `DecrefCellRegion` frees. Two mechanisms hold that order and
/// neither can see the other: the `decref_point` clamp places the box release at or
/// after every release routed through the cell (docs/impl/region/bindings.md § "A
/// cell's release lands at or after every release routed through that cell"), and
/// the frame-exit relocation declines a move that would carry the box release back
/// across such a read (docs/impl/region/mechanism.md § "A move that crosses a read
/// through the cell it frees is declined"). This states the property both exist to
/// hold, over the finished emission where the two meet.
