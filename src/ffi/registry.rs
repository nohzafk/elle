//! Process-global FFI library registry — the owner that makes a loaded library's
//! mapping outlive every thread.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! A loaded shared library registers per-thread cleanup with the C runtime: a
//! library like libgit2 (via OpenSSL) calls `pthread_key_create(&key, destructor)`
//! and stores a non-null value under that key on each thread that uses it, so glibc
//! invokes `destructor` from `__nptl_deallocate_tsd` as the OS thread exits. If the
//! library is `dlclose`d before that thread exits — which happens when an
//! `os/spawn` worker owns the only handle and drops it on teardown — the
//! thread-exit walk jumps into the now-unmapped page and the whole process dies
//! with SIGSEGV.
//!
//! The fix is the same discipline the plugin loader already uses
//! (`src/plugin.rs`: `std::mem::forget(lib)` — "plugins are never unloaded"):
//! **own the mapping process-globally and never `dlclose` it.** `dlopen`/`dlclose`
//! is refcounted process-wide, so one permanent holder keeps the refcount ≥ 1; a
//! worker that loads and exits never drives it to 0, so its later TSD destructor
//! always lands in mapped code. This is robust *independent of the exit path*
//! (`std::process::exit`/`_exit`/signals all leave the mapping in place — the OS
//! reclaims it at process death).
//!
//! ## Teardown is explicit, never automatic
//!
//! A program may attach an **ordered teardown destructor** to a library
//! (`register_teardown`, surfaced as `ffi/on-unload`) — e.g. libgit2's
//! `git_libgit2_shutdown`. These run only when the program explicitly asks
//! (`run_teardowns`, surfaced as `ffi/run-teardowns`), in reverse load order.
//! The runtime never runs them on its own: a teardown like `git_libgit2_shutdown`
//! deletes the pthread key it created, which races a *detached* worker still in its
//! own TSD-destructor walk — so the decision that all such workers have quiesced
//! (e.g. via `sys/join`) is the programmer's, made explicitly, not the runtime's
//! made behind their back. Teardown **never `dlclose`s**: the mapping stays for the
//! process lifetime regardless, which is exactly what keeps a late worker's TSD
//! walk safe. Skipping teardown entirely is therefore always safe.
