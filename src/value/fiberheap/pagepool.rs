//! Per-thread page cache for region allocation.

//! `PagePool` caches mmap'd pages organized by size class. When a region
//! needs a new page, it claims one from the pool (or mmaps fresh). When a
//! region is freed, its pages are returned to the pool for reuse. Pages
//! exceeding the cache limit are munmapped immediately.
//!
//! A page moves between a region and the cache untouched, in both directions:
//! no system call, no byte read or written, because the claimant stamps the
//! header and writes every slot it hands out. Under `--trace=scrub` a release
//! additionally blanks the spans the dying region wrote (`PageDirty`), so a
//! read through a pointer that outlived its region detonates instead of
//! returning plausible bytes. See docs/impl/region/model.md § "Page recycling".
