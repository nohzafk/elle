//! Diagnostic free log: records the page address ranges freed by each
//! `free_runtime_region_pages`, with whether the free was a *direct* decref (the region's
//! own `decref_point`) or a *cascade* decref (a referrer region's `free_runtime_region_pages`
//! decref'd it). When `arena::deref` hits a tag/object mismatch (the
//! use-after-free signature), it consults this log to attribute the
//! stale payload address to the region (and free kind) that reclaimed it.
//!
//! This split tells two failure modes apart: a direct free means a liveness
//! bug (decref_point fires while the value is still live); a cascade free means
//! a missing cross-region incref on the referrer. The log is only populated
//! when `--trace=free` is set, so it is zero-cost otherwise.
